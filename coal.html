<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-4">Coal Handling Plant</h1>

<p class="mb-4">
  The Coal Handling Plant (CHP) at OPGC is a critical facility responsible for receiving, 
storing, and supplying coal to the boiler units in a continuous and controlled manner. It ensures 
the efficient handling of raw coalâ€”from unloading at the railway yard or mine end to its final 
crushing, screening, and feeding into the boiler furnace. The CHP includes components such 
as track hoppers, conveyor belts, crushers, stacker-cum-reclaimers, and magnetic separators to 
facilitate smooth and automated coal flow, maintaining consistent fuel supply for uninterrupted 
power generation.

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-2">Main Systems Involved</h2>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
  <li><strong>Unloading:</strong> Wagon Tippler and Track Hopper receive coal from rail wagons.</li>
  <li><strong>Conveying:</strong> Belt conveyors transport coal across storage and feeding units.</li>
  <li><strong>Crushing:</strong> Crushers reduce large lumps to feedable size before entering the boiler.</li>
  <li><strong>Stacking & Reclaiming:</strong> Stacker Reclaimer stores and feeds coal into the system based on demand.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-2">Coal Delivery</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
  Coal is delivered to power plants based on their geographical location. For plants near rivers 
or coastal areas, coal is transported via ships or barges. In inland locations like OPGC, coal is 
primarily supplied through railway wagons or, where rail infrastructure is absent, by road 
through trucks. The choice of delivery mode depends on availability, distance, and logistics 
cost. 
</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-2">Coal Unloading</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
  The method of unloading coal depends on the delivery vehicle. If trucks are used, they can 
directly dump coal into outdoor storage yards without the need for unloading equipment. 
However, when coal is brought by railway wagons or ships, mechanical systems such as car 
shakers, rotary car dumpers, grab buckets, cranes, and coal accelerators are used to unload the 
material efficiently and safely. 
</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-2">Coal Preparation</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
  Raw coal often arrives in large lumps that are not suitable for combustion. To ensure efficient 
burning in boilers, coal undergoes a preparation process. This includes crushing, breaking, 
and sizing the coal using crushers, breakers, and sizers. Dryers may be used to remove 
moisture, and magnetic separators help remove any metallic impurities.
</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-2">Coal Transfer</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
  Once prepared, coal is transported to dead storage areas using a variety of mechanical 
systems. Commonly used equipment includes belt conveyors, screw conveyors, bucket 
elevators, and grab bucket elevators. These systems ensure continuous and controlled 
movement of coal within the plant premises.
