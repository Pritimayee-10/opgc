<!-- Steam Cycle: Rankine Cycle -->
<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-2 mt-10">Steam Cycle: Rankine Cycle</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
  The Rankine cycle is a thermodynamic process used in steam power plants to generate electricity. It operates in a closed loop where a working fluid, typically water, is continuously vaporized and condensed. The cycle involves four main processes that change the fluid’s state, enabling efficient energy conversion.

  <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 md:w-1/2">
    In the Rankine cycle, saturated liquid water at state 3 enters the pump and is compressed isentropically to a higher pressure (state 4). This increases temperature and pressure slightly. Heat is then added in the boiler to transform it into superheated steam (state 1), which expands through a turbine producing work output. Finally, the steam is condensed back to liquid at state 3 via the condenser.

<!-- Cooling Towers and Spray Ponds -->
<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-2">Cooling Towers and Spray Ponds</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
  Condensers in power plants need large volumes of water to condense exhaust steam from turbines. When natural sources like rivers are not available, OPGC uses cooling towers and spray ponds to release heat to the atmosphere and recirculate the water.
