  <section class="mb-6">
    <p class="mb-4">
      Odisha Power Generation Corporation Ltd. (OPGC) is a Government of Odisha undertaking established in 1984. Its primary objective is the generation of thermal power. The company operates thermal power plants in the IB valley area of Jharsuguda, Odisha, including Units 1 & 2 (210 MW each) and Units 3 & 4 (660 MW each).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      OPGCâ€™s strategic advantage lies in its proximity to coal mines and the Hirakud reservoir, enabling cost-effective and consistent power generation. Over the years, the organization has expanded through multiple modernization efforts and upgrades to ensure reliable electricity generation.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      In 2020, the Government of Odisha regained full control of OPGC by acquiring 49% of equity that was earlier held by AES Corporation (USA). This made OPGC a fully state-owned power generation utility.
